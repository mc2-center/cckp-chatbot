# Changelog

## cckp-copilot

### Unreleased

- Forked from `nf-osi/portal-chatbot`'s NF Portal Copilot and re-targeted at the Cancer Complexity Knowledge Portal (CCKP).
- Two backend variants: `cloudformation.sql.yaml` (SQL over Synapse View tables, deployable today) and `cloudformation.sparql.yaml` (SPARQL over a CCKP knowledge graph, pending a hosted endpoint).
- Instructions, redirect targets, and example queries rewritten for CCKP's Dataset/Publication/Tool/Grant/EducationalResource entities.
- Docs KB expanded to a second source: MC2 Center data model docs (mc2-center.github.io/data-models) alongside the CCKP help site, with a second crawl spider and instruction updates describing the two-source KB.
- SQL Lambda (`cckpSqlRag`) extended with dataset & file discovery (`getDatasetFiles`, `getFileDetails`, `checkRestriction`), `limit`/`nextPageToken` pagination, and more tolerant response parsing; per-id restriction info is now embedded directly in dataset/file responses so the agent can check public-accessibility before implying a resource is downloadable.
- Synapse registrations recorded for both SQL-variant stacks — `Cephy-sql-alpha-dev` (#336) and `Cephy-sql-alpha` (#335) — with manual AWS CLI deploy steps documented in `agents/README.md`. Still not deployed: no `AWS_OIDC_ROLE_ARN` role provisioned yet, so the `deploy-copilot-sql.yml`/`deploy-copilot-sparql.yml` CI/CD workflows remain inactive.
